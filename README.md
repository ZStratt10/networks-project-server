# Networks Project

This repository will be where we keep the source code for the Computer Networks project.

We are designing a web-based instant messaging platform, which will feature user authentication, end-to-end encryption, and role-based access control. For the sake of simplicity, this platform will start off as a two-user system.

The frontend features a sign up page, a login page, and a simple chat interface. Upon launch, users are directed to the sign in page, where they can either sign into an existing account or click a button to create a new account. When the user chooses to create an account, they are asked to enter a username, a password, and then a re-entry of their password for verification. Once the account is created, the user can then log in with their newly created account. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the chat page, where they can select another user with which they would like to chat and then begin sending messages.
